Project Title: Soil Moisture Detection and Audio Feedback System
Description:
This project uses an ESP32/ESP8266 board, a DFPlayer Mini MP3 module, and a soil moisture sensor to detect the moisture level of soil. The system provides an audio feedback based on the soil moisture condition:

Dry soil: Plays the first audio file (sound 1).
Hydrated soil: Plays the third audio file (sound 3).
Overwatered soil: Plays the second audio file (sound 2).
Key Features:
DFPlayer Mini MP3 Module for audio playback.
Soil Moisture Sensor to measure the moisture level in the soil.
Thresholds for determining dry, hydrated, and overwatered soil.
Audio feedback for each condition.
The project will provide feedback through the speaker when the soil reaches certain moisture levels, making it suitable for applications like smart irrigation systems or plant monitoring systems.

Hardware Requirements:
ESP32 or ESP8266 Board (any compatible board with at least one UART interface)
DFPlayer Mini MP3 Module (to play the audio files)
Soil Moisture Sensor (analog type)
Speaker (for audio output via DFPlayer)
MicroSD Card (with audio files stored)
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional, for easy connections)

Connections:
Soil Moisture Sensor:
VCC to 3.3V (or 5V, depending on sensor)
GND to GND
A0 to GPIO34 (or any available analog pin on ESP32/ESP8266)
DFPlayer Mini MP3 Module:
VCC to 5V (DFPlayer Mini typically works on 5V)
GND to GND
TX to GPIO17 (or any available TX pin on ESP32/ESP8266)
RX to GPIO16 (or any available RX pin on ESP32/ESP8266)
SPK+ and SPK- to the speaker
ESP32 Pinout Example (can vary depending on the board):
GPIO34 → Soil Moisture Sensor (Analog Pin)
GPIO16 → DFPlayer Mini RX (pin)
GPIO17 → DFPlayer Mini TX (pin)

SD Card:
Insert the microSD card into the DFPlayer Mini with your audio files in the root directory of the SD card.

Code Explanation:
Libraries Used:
DFRobotDFPlayerMini: Library to control the DFPlayer Mini MP3 module.
Code Logic:
Initialization:

The code starts by initializing serial communication for both the ESP32/ESP8266 (Serial for debugging) and the DFPlayer Mini (FPSerial for controlling the DFPlayer).
Sensor Reading:

The soil moisture sensor value is read using analogRead(soilSensorPin) and is checked against predefined thresholds:
Dry soil: If the moisture value is greater than the dryThreshold, it plays the first audio.
Hydrated soil: If the moisture value is between dryThreshold and overWateredThreshold, it plays the third audio.
Overwatered soil: If the moisture value is less than the overWateredThreshold, it plays the second audio.
Flags:
Flags (isDryPlayed, isWateredPlayed, isOverWateredPlayed) are used to ensure the correct audio is played only once when the soil enters a new state.
DFPlayer Audio Playback:
The playSound() function is used to play a specific sound file based on the sensor reading. The audio files should be named 1.mp3, 2.mp3, and 3.mp3 on the SD card.
Serial Debugging:
The Serial.println() statements print the soil moisture value for debugging purposes, which can be monitored via the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor.
Required Libraries:
To use the DFRobotDFPlayerMini library, you'll need to install it from the Arduino Library Manager:
Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries.
Search for DFRobotDFPlayerMini and install it.

How to Use:
Hardware Setup:

Connect the components according to the pin definitions mentioned above.
Insert the SD card with the audio files in the correct folder and ensure it's correctly formatted (FAT32).
Upload Code:
Upload the provided code to your ESP32/ESP8266 board using the Arduino IDE.
Open the Serial Monitor (set to 115200 baud rate) to view the moisture value readings.
Operation:
When the soil moisture is too dry, the first audio file will play.
When the soil is hydrated, the third audio file will play.
When the soil is overwatered, the second audio file will play.
The system ensures that each audio file plays only once for each condition change.
Future Improvements:
Add multiple thresholds for more granular control over the soil moisture conditions.
Implement a visual display (e.g., LED indicators) to show the soil condition.
Add automatic watering functionality using a water pump triggered by the soil moisture level.
